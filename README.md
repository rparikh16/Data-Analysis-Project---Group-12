Questions
What is the predicted delinquency rates of the current year for:
Q1
Q2
Q3
Q4
How do the provincial average delinquency rates compare to the national average?
Which province(s) and metropolitan areas have had the highest rates historically?
How do the provincial average income rates compare with mortgage delinquency rates?
How do rising interest rates and mortgage deliquiency rates affect the economy?
How do rise and fall of interest rates affect the rental market?

### Inputs
- Unemployment Rate
- CPI Change
- Labour Force Participation Rate
- Delinquency Rates
- Average New Mortgage Rates
- Average Household Income

### Outcome
- 2023 Deliquency rate/foreclosure rate
- How do the historic deliquiency and foreclosure rates along with the different features predict the deliquency rates and property foreclosures for the next year by province and nation?
- Goal is determine if we see a rise in mortgage arrears this year due to a potential housing market crash?

### ML models we could use
- Random Forest: This is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions. Reason: It is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and is robust to outliers.
- Linear Regression: This is a simple yet powerful model that can predict if there is a linear relationship between the delinquency rates and the other features.  It is also easy to interpret and can be used to identify the most important factors that influence the outcome.
- Neural Networks: This is a powerful model that can handle high dimensional data. It can be used to predict a wide range of outcomes, including delinquency rates. However, they are complex to interpret and can be time-consuming to train.
